# Fun-with-Filesystems
This block of code is from a project that I did for my own education. I learned how filesystems worked and played around with the pathlib module 
in python, which allowed me to explore paths, files, and how to work with pathobjects. The main concepts I focused on was recursion and working with the operating system.
The code that is included in this repository gets a path from the user (first line), filter criteria for the files (second line), and action specification (third line).
Users choose what they want to do with the file--they can touch it, copy it to the same directory, print the path to the console, or read lines from the file
